This repository contains the codes for the article  "A comparative study of different control strategies for active heave compensation".

Controllers Implemented

1. PD (Proportional-Derivative Control)
2. MPC (Model Predictive Control)
3. LQI (Linear Quadratic Integral Compensator)
4. SMC (Sliding Mode Control)

Cases Analysed

1. No disturbance and no measurement noise
2. Ability to handle saturation of the swash angle
3. Offset Tracking
4. With disturbance but no measurement noise
5. With measurement noise but no disturbance [High Noise and Low Noise]
